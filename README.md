## Overview

The AI Agents Project is an open-source initiative that aims to create intelligent agents capable of automating tasks, integrating with blockchain technology leveraging the power _DeepSeek Model_, and providing voice assistance. This project includes modules for voice processing, agent models, email automation, and blockchain integration.

## Features

- **Voice Pipeline**: Includes voice recognition, text-to-speech, and audio processing capabilities.
- **Agent Models**: Implements various AI agents, including DeepSeek and OpenAI-based agents.
- **Email Automation**: Automates sending and receiving emails.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Connects with blockchain networks and manages smart contracts.

## Caution

**This project is in the early stages of development.** Many features are still under construction, and it may not be suitable for production use at this time. Please use with caution and be prepared for potential issues.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Agents-Project.git
   cd AI-Agents-Project
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

#### Voice Pipeline

To use the voice pipeline, you can run the following command:

```bash
python voice_pipeline/voice_recognition.py
```

#### Agents

To create and use an AI agent, you can instantiate it as follows:

```python
from agents.agent_model import Agent

my_agent = Agent("TestAgent")
my_agent.perform_task()
```

#### Email Automation

To send an email, use the email sender module:

```python
from email_automation.email_sender import EmailSender

sender = EmailSender("smtp.example.com", 587, "user@example.com", "password")
sender.send_email("recipient@example.com", "Subject", "Email body")
```

#### Blockchain Integration

To interact with the blockchain, use the blockchain integration module:

```python
from blockchain.blockchain_integration import Blockchain

blockchain = Blockchain("https://your.blockchain.node")
blockchain.connect()
```

## Testing

To run the tests, navigate to the `tests` directory and run:

```bash
pytest
```
